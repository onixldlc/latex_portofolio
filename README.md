# latex_portofolio

this is my simple latex portofolio template

## USAGE
to use this you just need to rename the personal-data file and compile it using xelatex

### SETUP
to use this go to the `./component` and rename `personal-data.tex.example` to `personal-data.tex` and change some data in it

### COMPILE
to compile this just run
```
xelatex main.tex
```
and you should endup with main.pdf


## CREDIT
thanks to Dipan Nanda for making the template accessible on overleaf in the first place
